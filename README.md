TUF-2000M
Task: Create a program that parses the data, converts it to human readable data like integers, decimals and strings and presents it in a nice way. Depending on your skills and interests you can create a web service that will provide the conversion data, or you could even create a UI to visualize the data somehow, it is entirely up to you what you make of it!
For the first 100 register from TUF-2000M, I notice that there are 4 type of value: REAL4, LONG, INTEGER and BCD. So i pair the value of those type corresponding with the Technical manual.
First, I convert those value into binary value, put them into list, then reperate into 4 parts, with 4 format, then solve each format in each window. Use the input.txt or input1.txt file to read data(attached in the project)
You can download the project and run immidiately on Visual Studio, or download the setup with the link below:
